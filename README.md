## Getting Started

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/camillecata/AI-Summary-Assistant.git
cd AI-Summary-Assistant
```

### 2. Set up your virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add your API keys

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
touch .env
```

Paste your keys into `.env`:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key
SERPAPI_API_KEY=your-serpapi-api-key
```

You can also copy from `.env.example` — just rename it to `.env` and fill in your values.

⚠️ Do not commit `.env` — it is already included in `.gitignore`.

### 5. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
